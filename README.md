# Toyota_Corolla_PricePrediction_GridSearchCV_CrossVal
## Regression Task Project1
1. Applied all the regression model learned so far. If your model has a scaling parameter(s) use Grid Search to find the best scaling parameter. 
2. Use plots and graphs to help you get a better glimpse of the results.
3. Then used cross-validation to find average training and testing score.
4. Regression models used: KNN repressor, linear regression, Ridge, Lasso, polynomial regression, SVM both simple and with kernels (rbf, poly, linear).
5. Finally, find the best regressor for this dataset and train your model on the entire dataset using the best parameters and predict the target values for the test_set.
